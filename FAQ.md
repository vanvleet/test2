# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q:** *Can I contribute to the repository?*  
**A:** YES! We would love to receive contributions of excellent technique
research and modeling! To begin contributing, please follow the information
detailed in the [Contribution Guide].

**Q:** *What if my technique is partially covered by an existing TRR?*  
**A:** Add an “update” branch and PR to that TRR rather than creating a new one.
See the section [Adding to an Existing TRR] in the contribution guide for
details.

**Q:** *Can I submit a TRR for an Execution tactic?*  
**A:** We are unlikely to accept TRRs for a technique under the "Execution"
tactic. This is because most techniques under the "Execution" tactic are
actually tools that can implement all techniques. You can find more detail at
[Mistaken Identification: When an Attack Technique isn’t a Technique]. If you
submit a TRR for one of these techniques, we'll probably ask you to re-scope the
TRR to whatever technique it's actually discussing.
